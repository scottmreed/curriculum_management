# diff_calculator

A difference finder made with Python. It basically takes in two input files for input data, compares them, and return a color coded output with differences.

It's simple to use, just place the files with name "CLSSHED.csv" in "ori" and "changed" sub-folders in data folder. Data folder also has header for more information about the data in excel sheets
Alternatively, leave ori empty and comparison will be made between changed folder and latest matched csv file for that semester.
